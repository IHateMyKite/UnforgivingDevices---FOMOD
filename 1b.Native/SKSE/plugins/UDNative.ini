[Disabler]
# If free camera should disable most controls, with exception of movement
# Reason is that it is impossible to combain existing control override with free camera controls
# So either the camera have to be fully free (which alows user to basically cheat by opening any manu while in free camera mod), or just disable everything.
# VALUE = true/false
